This is Markdown content. Prioritize clarity, structure, and semantic hierarchy.

### Formatting Rules
- Use `#` through `####` to define heading levels (no skipping levels)
- Leave an empty line before and after headers and lists
- Use `-` for unordered lists, `1.` for ordered lists
- Use fenced code blocks (` ```lang `) for any code or CLI examples
- Bold key terms with `**` and use _italics_ sparingly
- Use inline links `[text](http://localhost/#)` â€” avoid bare URLs

### Style Conventions
- Start with a top-level heading
- Prefer short paragraphs
- Use consistent tense (present preferred)
- Group by sections like: Overview, Prerequisites, Usage, Examples, Notes

### Special Rules
- For architecture docs, use:
  - `## Decision Log` for tradeoffs
  - `## Diagrams` and embed image links or PlantUML blocks
- For README files:
  - Start with a 1-line summary
  - Follow with badges, installation, usage, and contribution sections
